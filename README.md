### Microservices E-commerce Order Flow

This project demonstrates a robust microservices architecture for an e-commerce order system, leveraging **RabbitMQ** as a message broker for asynchronous communication. The solution is composed of three distinct APIs: `OrderAPI`, `StockAPI`, and `PaymentAPI`, which communicate indirectly through a series of domain events. This architectural design ensures services remain **loosely coupled**, which is paramount for achieving greater scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

### Architectural Overview & Event-Driven Workflow

The diagram below provides a visual representation of the event-driven communication flow that orchestrates the order creation process. This pattern allows each service to operate independently, responding to events rather than direct requests, which mitigates single points of failure.

### Core Workflow: A Step-by-Step Journey ðŸš€

#### 1\. Order API: The Command Center

A client request initiates the workflow. The `OrderAPI` first persists the order in its **MSSQL** database with a **`Suspend`** status. This is a crucial step to ensure atomicity and a consistent state. It then emits an **`OrderCreatedEvent`** to RabbitMQ, decoupling the order creation from the downstream processes.

\<br\>

#### 2\. Stock API: The Inventory Guard

The `StockAPI` consumes the **`OrderCreatedEvent`**. It performs a critical stock check and, if available, reserves the items by decrementing the count in its **MongoDB** database. This action is followed by publishing a **`StockReservedEvent`**, serving as a green light for payment processing.

\<br\>

#### 3\. Payment API: The Financial Gateway

The `PaymentAPI` consumes the **`StockReservedEvent`**. It processes the payment and, based on the outcome, publishes a **`PaymentCompletedEvent`** or **`PaymentFailedEvent`**. This decision-making step is central to the system's reliability.

\<br\>

#### 4\. Order API: The Finalizer

Finally, the `OrderAPI` consumes the payment result events. If a **`PaymentCompletedEvent`** is received, it updates the order's status to **`Completed`**, finalizing the transaction. If a **`PaymentFailedEvent`** is received, it updates the status to **`Failed`** and can trigger compensation logic, such as releasing the reserved stock.

This event-driven flow ensures that each service is highly focused and efficient, while the entire system remains responsive and resilient to failures in any single component.
